Background:

Due to its ability to provide real time imaging, ANPR is beneficial to many numbers of industries including the government and IT sector. In past, number plate registration process took long time and then it took even long time to send the penalty notices to the people who broke the traffic rules. However, after using the ANPR the number plate is recognized and compared with the database which is already stored at the time of registration and a penalty notice is immediately sent to the persons who broke the traffic laws. The cameras rapidly enable the immediate response to criminal activity to ensure that no criminal activity goes unchecked. It is also helpful to recognize the criminals from the traffic camera.
